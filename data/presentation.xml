			<text>Aim of the tutorial and learning outcomes
When conducting null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), statistical tests provide us with a p-value. 
This tutorial will help explain what the p-value represents and how to interpret it.
You should allow about 30 minutes to work through the tutorial.

After completing this tutorial you should be able to:
Understand the correct definition of a p-value
Interpret a p-value in relation to a null hypothesis
Interpret p-values of studies reported in academic journals</text>

			<text>The fairness of an ancient coin
Let’s start with an example. Suppose we found an ancient coin that had been buried underground. 
If we were to flip it, we might expect the likelihood of it landing heads to be the same as the likelihood of it landing tails. 
In other words, a 50% chance of it landing heads and a 50% chance of it landing tails. 
However, perhaps when ancient coins were made, they were not manufactured very consistently and sometimes were heavier on one side such that they tended to land on heads.
We might then hypothesise that there is not an equal likelihood of it landing heads as there is of it landing tails – perhaps the coin is biased?
Heads
Tails</text>

			<text>Is the coin biased?
To test this question, we can set-up our null hypothesis and our experimental hypothesis:

Null hypothesis (H0):
‘the coin is a fair coin – there is an equal chance of getting a heads as getting a tails’

Experimental hypothesis (H1):
‘the coin is a biased coin – there is a greater chance of getting a heads than getting a tails’
the null hypothesis is a default position, and often quite boring or unsurprising!
the experimental hypothesis proposes something other than the default boring position!

			<text>Let’s collect some data
Ok, lets flip the coin again…
The coin landed on a heads yet again! 
By now you might think that there is something odd about this coin. 
Third flip:
Heads
Fourth flip:
Heads
Second flip:
Heads
First flip:
Heads
Reminder of the question and hypotheses:
Question: Is the coin a biased coin?
H0: the coin is a fair coin – there is an equal chance of getting a heads as getting a tails
H1: the coin is a biased coin – there is a greater chance of getting a heads than getting a tails
The answer is: 0.0625
(i.e. 6.25%, or a 1 in 16 chance)

This is our p-value, so p = 0.0625
(or 0.063 rounded to three decimal places)

			<text>Re-visiting the hypotheses
You are probably now very suspicious that the coin is a fair coin!
If the null hypothesis is true, i.e. if the coin is indeed fair, we would expect to get a heads on five flips of the coin only 1 in every 32 times we repeat the task. 
This seems fairly unlikely. The coin could be a fair coin, but if it is, it would be quite unlikely to get a heads five times in a row.
Based on the data we’ve collected, it’s now looking that our experimental hypothesis (that the coin is biased to land on heads) is quite plausible, and our null hypothesis (that the coin is fair) is not very plausible.
hypothesis testing always starts by assuming the null hypothesis is true</text>

			<text>So what is a p-value?
A p-value is…
“the probability of observing the data we’ve collected, or data that is more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true.”

What is meant by ‘data that is more extreme’?
Well, lets say we started flipping the coin again, but this time we got four heads and one tails. The p-value would represent the probability of four heads out of five (i.e. the data collected) plus the probability of five heads and no tails (i.e. data that is more extreme than that observed).
this is an important concept – take your time to understand the wording</text>

			<text>When do we reject the null?
In the field of psychology, researchers have agreed that if the observed data is only likely to happen by chance under the null hypothesis with a probability of 0.05 or less (i.e. 5% or 1 in 20 times, or less), then we have enough evidence to be suspicious of the null hypothesis. 
The threshold at which we are suspicious of the null hypothesis is called ‘alpha’

In psychology, alpha is set at 0.05
So if p is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis in favour of the experimental hypothesis.</text>

			<text>How do p-values relate to psychology studies?
The researchers also looked at the proportion of winners wearing red and blue in boxing and wrestling. 
Across all the sports they found a consistent pattern that there were more red winners than blue winners.
Using a statistical test to analyse the data the study’s authors calculated that their results had a p-value of: 
p = 0.041 (or 4.1%)
In other words, if the null hypothesis is true – that red does not influence dominance in competitive situation, the probability of observing the data collected (45 red wins to 34 blue wins) is 0.041, which is quite a low probability.
You will learn about statistical tests and how to calculate
p-values later on the course</text>

			<text>Common misconceptions
The meaning of a p-value is sometimes misinterpreted.

A p-value does not tell us:
the probability that the null hypothesis is true.
how important the research finding is.
whether a scientific conclusion should be taken as a fact.

 
a p-value less than 0.05 indicates statistical significance, but it does not tell us whether the finding is actually important or interesting.</text>

The definition of a p-value is:
“the probability of observing the data we’ve collected, or data that is more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true.”

If the p-value is less than 0.05 (5%), i.e. quite unlikely, then we reject the null hypothesis in favour of the experimental hypothesis.

If the p-value is greater than 0.05 (5%) then we retain the null hypothesis.
